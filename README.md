# [Github Linguist](https://github.com/github/linguist) example

This is an example of using `.gitattributes` to control languages breakdown chart displaying in Github.
Here I just mark JavaScript files as vendor files<sup>1</sup>, so the charts shows 100% of CSS, although it should show something like 71% of JavaScript and 29% of CSS.

<sup>1</sup> _GH Linguist ignores vendor files in breakdown chart._
